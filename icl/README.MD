## ICL Approach of Classification using Llama3.1:8b

In this project, we have employed the ICL (In-Context Learning) approach for classification using the Llama3.1:8b model. Here are the key reasons for this choice:

- **Feasibility and Speed**: The ICL method is highly feasible and fast, which is essential for developing a working prototype of our idea.
- **Leverage Powerful Capabilities**: Using ICL allows us to utilize the powerful capabilities of the Llama3.1:8b model without the need for extensive training.
- **Practical Solution**: Given the current needs of the project, ICL provides a more practical solution compared to other approaches.
- **Community Feedback**: The decision was also influenced by a suggestion from a Reddit post I made, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1hq98fa/how_to_generate_text_dataset_using_llama_31/). The community feedback highlighted the advantages of using ICL for rapid prototyping and efficient classification tasks.
